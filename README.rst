Eve-App
========

A fully featured RESTful Web API powered by Eve_. With Eve setting up an API is
very simple. You just need a launch script (run.py_) and a configuration file
(settings.py_). Check out the settings.py_ module in this repo to get an idea
of how configuration is handled. Don't forget to visit Eve_ website for
a complete list of features and examples.
